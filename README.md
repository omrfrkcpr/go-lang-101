GoLang Guide for Beginners

- Developed by Google in 2007
- Go is a statically typed, compiled language that runs on multiple platforms. It is designed to be fast and flexible with a large number of languages.
- Open-sourced in 2009
- Multi-threaded language support (Do multiple things at once)
- Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once
- Developers need to write code to prevent conflicts, when tasks run in parallel.

- Multi-Core Concurrency Support = Languages

  - Built-in Concurrency Mechanism: C++, Java, Go
  - No Built-in Concurrency Mechanism: Python, Nodejs

- Use Cases:

  - For Performant Applications
  - Running on scaled, distributed systems

- Characteristics of Go:

  - Simple and readable syntax of a dinamically typed language like Python
  - Efficiency and safety of a lower-level, statically typed language like C++
  - Cheap and easy to use
  - Go is a statically typed language, which means that the type of every expression must be known at
  - Fast build time, start up and run
  - Requires fewer resources
  - (Compiled Language) Go code is transformed into machine code by a compiler before it can run on a computer.

- SDK - Software Development Kit : SDKs are designed to simplify the development process by providing pre-build components and utilities.

- Go SDK allows developers to build applications using Go's core libraries, compiler and tools.

- IDE = Integrated Development Environment

  - IDEs are more powerful than simple code editors.
  - They combine code editing, compiling, debugging, version control integration, command line etc. into one tool.

- GOROOT tells the system, where the Go SDK is installed.
- GOPATH defines the workspace for Go projects and packages.
